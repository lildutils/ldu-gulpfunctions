# ldu-gulpfunctions

Gulp Functions from LilDutils for create project gulpfile.js easy and fast.

## Development

For development you should run the install commend first.

The **install** set up the dependencies for development, and downloads everything from the pacakage.json file via [Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/).

After that you can run the serve command.

The **serve** makes it easy to coding, because it is watching the source directory, and compile everything into *_dist* folder, everytime if you make any change.
NOTE: default profile is the 'dev' profile.

### Install

```sh
npm install
```

### Serve

```sh
gulp serve
```

## Build

The **build** creates an npm package under the *_build* directory, which can add the to your project the generated package.
NOTE: default profile is the 'prod' profile.

If you want to build the source code, you should run the following command:

```sh
gulp build
```
